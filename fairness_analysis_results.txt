SUMMARY AND INTERPRETATION
==========================
1. Statistical Parity Difference: Values closer to 0 indicate more fairness.
2. Disparate Impact: Values closer to 1 indicate more fairness.
3. Equal Opportunity Difference: Values closer to 0 indicate more fairness.
4. Average Odds Difference: Values closer to 0 indicate more fairness.

CONCLUSION
==========
This analysis demonstrates how bias mitigation techniques can improve fairness in machine learning models.
For gender bias, Reject Option Classification was more effective overall in improving fairness metrics.
For race bias, Reject Option Classification was more effective overall in improving fairness metrics.

Accuracy decreased by 0.0018 with Reweighing and by -0.0055 with Reject Option Classification.
This illustrates the common tradeoff between model accuracy and fairness.

Recommendation: When deploying models that make predictions about individuals, it's important to 
consider both performance metrics and fairness metrics. Depending on the specific use case and legal/ethical 
requirements, different bias mitigation strategies may be appropriate.
